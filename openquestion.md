Why Macro F1 Beats Other Choices Here
1 · Class-Imbalance Robustness
In multi-label datasets the long-tail problem is the norm: a few tags dominate, most appear sparsely. Micro F1 (or plain accuracy) would let popular classes swamp the metric; a model could score high while ignoring rare tags. Macro F1 neutralises that by giving every tag identical leverage in the final score.

2 · Single Scalar, Easy Early-Stopping
Compared with PR-AUC or mAP—which require computing an area under a curve for each class—macro F1 is a single scalar already averaged, so it’s cheap to compute every epoch and easy to plug into ReduceLROnPlateau or similar schedulers.

3 · Directly Optimises the Tagging Objective
Our downstream consumer cares about getting each tag right at least most of the time, not ranking images by confidence or maximising recall at K. F1’s harmonic mean balances precision and recall, which matches reviewers’ anecdotal “does this tag belong here?” acceptance test.

When a Different Metric Makes Sense
Scenario	Better Candidate Metric	Rationale
Extreme label imbalance, but missing even one rare class is tolerable	Micro F1	Weighs samples, so majority classes drive learning. 
datascience.stackexchange.com
Retrieval-style use-case (ranked lists)	mAP (mean Average Precision)	Looks at ranking quality over many thresholds. 
kaggle.com
Medical or fraud screening where positives are scarce but critical	PR-AUC	Focuses on precision–recall trade-off; better than ROC under heavy imbalance. 
stats.stackexchange.com
Binary or few-label tasks with calibratable probabilities	ROC-AUC	Threshold-independent discrimination power.
